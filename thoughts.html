      <p>
      I went through a phase this week of really wanting `karle.[original-tld]`.
      Not for a business. Not for boosting my own webpage (it doesn't really
      have much). Just for me.
      </p>

      <p>The results were... disheartening.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>karle.org:</b><br> Registered since 1998, no website, parked web-page.
          WHOIS guard ensures I can't even reach out to who owns it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>karle.com:</b><br> For sale by owner on Uniregistry. Ok. Inquired.
            Owner wants a "serious 5 figure offer". Next!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>karle.net:</b><br> Owned by <a
            href="https://realnames.com">RealNames</a>, a business seemingly
          centered around buying lastname.net domains and charging people like
          me to set up an email. Almost brilliant enough of a business to make
          me forgive their scumminess.  <i>Almost</i>. Nary an option to buy
          it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>So here we are. Looks like karle.co for at least a little longer.</p>

      <p>
      Toying with the thought of starting a website/blog.
      </p>
      <p>
      Exploring my hosting options and pleasantly surprised that
      <a href="https://fastmail.com">Fastmail</a> has free static site hosting!

      <p>
      Inspired by Jeff Huang's article on websites
      <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last">Designed to Last</a> and
      a general desire for a simpler web.
