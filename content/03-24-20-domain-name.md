### Mar. 24, 2020: What's in a (domain) name?

I went through a phase this week of really wanting `karle.[original-tld]`.
Not for a business. Not for boosting my own webpage (it doesn't really
have much). Just for me.

The results were... disheartening.

* **karle.org:**<br> Registered since 2004, no website, just an email
DNS record.  WHOIS guard ensures I can't even reach out to who owns it.

* **karle.com:**<br> For sale by owner on Uniregistry. Ok. Inquired.
Owner wants a "serious 5 figure offer". Next!

* **karle.net:**<br> Owned by [RealNames](https://realnames.com),
a business seemingly centered around buying lastname.net domains and
charging people like me to set up an email. Almost brilliant enough of a
business to make me forgive their scumminess.  _Almost_. Nary an
option to buy it.

So here we are. Looks like karle.co for at least a little longer.
