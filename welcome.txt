Welcome to text.alexkarle.com!

This is an experimental version of my main site (alexkarle.com)
in text-only format. For maximum retro effect, I serve up this
directory over HTTP, HTTPS, and Gopher.

I've been serving txt versions of my mdoc(7) for a while over
Gopher, but decided to formalize the subtree generation and serve
it over HTTP after reading text.causal.agency, which you should
totally check out. (aside: I'd like to state that I've been doing
the whole mdoc(7) thing before I knew about causal.agency and am
not a complete copycat (much respect, great minds think alike and
all that) :) )

I hope you enjoy your stay! If you think this is cool, don't
hesitate to reach out: text@alexkarle.com
