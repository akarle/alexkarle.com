garbash was an invite-only [tilde](https://tildeverse.org)
community that was retired in early 2023.

[~alex's page](/garbash/~alex) as well as the
[config](https://git.alexkarle.com/garbash-config) were kept
for historical purposes, and has some info on how to set
up a tilde, should you be interested!

To all who participated--thanks, it was fun!

*NOTE:* As of 2024 the garbash.com domain was decommissioned.
I've updated any URLs to alexkarle.com, but left tutorials
referencing it where appropriate. It's been snatched up by
domain squatters, so don't go visiting :(
