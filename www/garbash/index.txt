## Sysadmin Notes

As ~anthony and I set up the tilde, I tried to document
every step of the way so that others could learn from it
and/or follow in our footsteps!

As the years have gone by, I'm also just glad I did it
for myself :)

**NOTE:** As of 2024 the garbash.com domain was decommissioned.
I've updated any URLs to alexkarle.com, but left tutorials
referencing it where appropriate. It's been snatched up by
domain squatters, so don't go visiting :(
