# 001-domain-name

_Fri Sep 17, 2021_

garbash the word was all ~anthony's idea.

It came out of a PR review as a self-deprecating take on his bash
(which actually turned out to be mine).

We laughed and I realized the domain was for sale, so I snagged it
and resolved to find its purpose later.

I've always wanted to be part of a tilde community, but struggle
opening up to strangers on the internet. Starting a tilde with a
friend, however, felt much more promising. All the ascii and none
of the awkwardness!

So here we are a week later, standing up this site. Hope you enjoy
your stay!
