# 004-mail-server

_Tues Sept 21, 2021_

We threw this together late in our first pairing session to set
up the site. I think having a solid email server is an important
part of standing up a site (allows forwarding cron email to an
inbox that's read, etc). And of course giving out email accounts
is crucial to attract people to a tilde ;)

The setup mostly followed Gilles' [excellent
post](https://poolp.org/posts/2019-09-14/setting-up-a-mail-server-with-opensmtpd-dovecot-and-rspamd/)
but I replaced the rspamd bits with opensmtpd-filter-dkimsign, which is super
simple to set up (see the README that comes with the installed pkg).

I'll post the whole config soon once we get git hosting set up!

Git hosting is up and here's the
