# 012-mailing-lists

_Weds April 27, 2022_

I surprised myself today while revisiting this site
to find that I had set up mailing lists months ago.
Or something that resembles them.

We don't have any users other than myself and ~anthony,
so they've gone unused, but my vision for the tilde
is one that uses email for collaboration (outside of
IRC).

I don't have any experience setting up majordomo or
anything like that, but since all accounts are local I
was able to create a "mailing list" by just updating
/etc/mail/aliases with the lists:

	announce: alex, anthony

And rerunning `newaliases(8)`. Hacky but it works!
I wonder if they have a limit...

In addition, I had set up primitive HTML archives using
`hypermail(1)`. A dedicated user account to manage the
archives simply runs the following every 5m via `cron(8)`:


	#!/bin/sh
	# archiveit -- regular archives
	for l in announce bugs dev misc; do
		hypermail -d /var/www/htdocs/lists/$l -g -m /var/lists/$l
	done


Pop it behind the VPN and serve it up with `httpd(8)` and
we have a mailing list archive so new members can see
the old conversations!
