# 003-httpd

_Tues Sept 21, 2021_

One of the first things I do when I set up a machine is set up
httpd(8) and grab a HTTPS cert via acme-client(8).

Here's a quick rundown (though reading the man pages is worth
the time!).

	# sed 's/example.com/garbash.com/g' \
	    /etc/examples/httpd.conf > /etc/httpd.conf
	# sed 's/example.com/garbash.com/g' \
	    /etc/examples/acme-client.conf > /etc/acme-client.conf

Then go in and edit the files to add aliases if needed!

To get the certs for the first time:

	# rcctl enable httpd
	# rcctl start httpd
	# acme-client -v garbash.com   # get certs
	# rcctl reload httpd           # load certs

Finally, to keep the certs up to date, add the following to the
crontab:

	# crontab -e
	...
	~ * * * * acme-client garbash.com && rcctl reload httpd
