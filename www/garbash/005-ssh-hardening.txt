# 005-ssh-hardening

_Tues Sept 21, 2021_

Just a quick note/reminder that one of the FIRST things you should
ALWAYS do on a new machine is make sure:

1. root cannot log in (PermitRootLogin no)
2. passwords are not accepted (ssh-key only -- PasswordAuthentication no)

Both these are set under `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`. Make sure to upload
your `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` first to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (so as not
to lock yourself out!) and then make the edits and reload the daemon:

	# rcctl reload sshd

We waited literally only 4 hrs to do this and we already had script
kiddies knocking down our /var/log/authlog :(

If my old coworker Joe was right about one thing, it's that the
internet these days is a cesspool.
