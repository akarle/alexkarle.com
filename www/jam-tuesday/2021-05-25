Solid jam night, a good mix of old and new. Who knew the bassline
to Billie Jean was so funky? I certainly forgot. The banger of the
night would have to go to one of the many Shadow People reprises.
I'm writing a couple days late, so I can't remember exactly which
songs we blended with SP, but I'd say at least two to three!
