# A New Hope

_Published: December 19, 2019_

Toying with the thought of starting a website/blog.

Exploring my hosting options and pleasantly surprised that
[FastMail](https://fastmail.com) has free static site hosting!

Inspired by [Jeff Huang's article](https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last)
on websites Designed to Last and a general desire for a simpler web.
