# What's in a (Domain) Name

_Published: March 24, 2020_

I went through a phase this week of really wanting
`karle.[original-tld]`.  Not for a business.  Not for boosting my
own webpage (it doesn't really have much traffic).  Just for me.

The results were... disheartening.

*karle.org*

Registered since 2004, no website, just an email DNS record.  WHOIS
guard ensures I can't even reach out to who owns it.

*karle.com*

For sale by owner on Uniregistry. Ok.  Inquired. Owner wants a
"serious 5 figure offer". Next!

*karle.net*

Owned by [RealNames](https://realnames.com), a business seemingly
centered around buying lastname.net domains and charging people
like me to set up an email.  Almost brilliant enough of a business
to make me forgive their scumminess.  _Almost._  Nary an option to
buy it.


## Conclusion

So here we are.  Looks like `karle.co` for at least a little
longer.

*Update:* I've settled on alexkarle.com and plan to use it for the
foreseeable future.
