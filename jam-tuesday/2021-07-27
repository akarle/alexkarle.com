7/27/21 -- the final jam

A bittersweet night for sure. After about 9 months of jamming (only 4 of which
were recorded), our streak has come to an end. Next week, Matt flies out to
hike the John Muir trail and when he's back, he goes back to college. He'll be
close by (35m), but I know how college is--he'll be wanting to hang with friends
his age :)

Ironically, we spent the first hour of our jam portion of the night talking CS.
He's a tutor for the upcoming year, and the tutors had a leaderboard for their
time and resource usage on a particular problem set. We talked bloom filters,
hash maps, and more! He's a smart guy--really fun to problem solve with!

The jam portion was a mix of recent favorites and old classics. I think we 
paid good tribute to all the sessions past.
