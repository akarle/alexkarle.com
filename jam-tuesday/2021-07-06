After a week off due to holidays, we are back! In the time off I realized
that Cigarette Daydreams has a similar chord progression to our favorite
mashup--Brian's Movie / Real Love Baby, so you know we had to play it!
Banger of the night goes out to that trio, although Before He Cheats was
a super fun throwback too.
