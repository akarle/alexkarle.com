Matt's just left--writing the setlist down before doing the dishes.
Fun night per usual. On call at work, but the bugs took pity on our
jams and it was a quiet evening (fingers crossed it stays that way!).

Banger of the night would have to go to Character Zero. Solid chord
progression, and we've been becoming a jam band slowly anyways.. why
not cover one? Matt's laptop rain out of battery at the end so it was
a bass heavy set for him!
