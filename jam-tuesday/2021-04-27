This Jam Tuesday with a special guest! My sister Sammy up from
Duke Med for spring break :) She's a great singer, and notoriously
dislikes the front bottoms, so it was fun to change up the setlist
and play some new songs!

There was an increase in rapping. We managed Kanye pretty well,
OutKast proved more difficult than expected to sight-rap :)
