A special guest tonight! Matt Cooper, my good friend from high school
(who I also work with these days), came over to jam with Matt and I.
In high school we were in a band together and shared a lot of music
so the setlist was very 2010's angst :)

Banger of the night might have to go out to Bed Head, although the
Legit Tattoo Gun rendition was spontaneous and we killed the three
part harmonies.
