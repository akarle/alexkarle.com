Awesome jam night per usual. Cut short a bit abruptly due to a work email
indicating a failure in prod... but overall got in quite a good set! The
night was heavy on Manchester Orchestra (due to their new album drop last
Friday) as well as Peach Pit (due to recent listening habits)--banger of
the night? Shake it Out. Surprise Transition? Creep -> Back Pocket
