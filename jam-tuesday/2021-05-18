Missed last week due to Matt being in VT, so it felt great to get
back to some jams! We had a bit of a late start due to a great dinner
conversation, so the setlist was a bit short, but it was one of the
better "blend" sessions in the while--we were throwing callbacks to
other songs left and right! The banger of the evening--Radar Detector,
with Twin Size Mattress and Brian's Movie both thrown in over an
extended outro.
