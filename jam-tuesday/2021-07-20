Special jam night tonight! It was our mom's bday this past week so
we (for the first time ever) invited her to sit in (with our dad
too) and listen. A VIP pass, if you will.

It was a solid setlist. She's not a front bottoms fan, but we snuck
a few in (arguably we sing it better than Sella... or at least in
a less polarizing voice).
