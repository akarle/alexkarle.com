Jam night with a twist! Not only did we continue the trend of Matt on
guitar while I play bass, but Matt took bass on the some of my hit bass
songs (Lauren, That I Miss You)! He nailed it of course.

Banger of the night: Aunt Leslie--when Matt figured out that A Sua Voz
had the same end chord structure ("My mind just melts away") and started
the horn part on keys, it just clicked and came together spontaneously!
