Fun jam night per usual. Tonight's theme was "rejection", since a friend
of mine got rejected by my own company, despite the referral. To make
matters stranger, I'm vacationing with him tomorrow, and it's fresh.
So, to pay tribute, we played some angsty songs and ended on an optimistic
note--we will still be friends!

Banger of the night would have to go to I Will Possess Your Heart. That
bass line. Lots of fun new additions though, so it's a close call.
