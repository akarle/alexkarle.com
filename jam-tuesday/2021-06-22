Shorter jam night since we got started a bit late (~9pm) and
ended a bit early (~10:30), due to Matt needing to go help a friend
with some CS stuff. However, it was still a great sesh! During our
usual setbreak ~10pm we bought tickets to go see Manchester Orchestra
on their upcoming tour. The excitement is real! The set list reflects
it :)

Banger of the night--I Can Feel A Hot One. Not a "banger" per se, but
we killed the harmonies.
